# Getting Started

Check if you have npm installed with this command  - `npm -v`

Then after cloning the repo, run this command

`npm run install`

This will install the required dependencies. Learn more about npm here - [NPM's website](https://www.npmjs.com/)

After installing the dependencies, run this command 

`expo start`

This will start the expo bundler in your terminal and open up the UI in your default browser. From here you can select which device you want to create the bundle for. More on expo here - [Expo](https://expo.io/)
